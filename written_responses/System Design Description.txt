The design of the system I made leads with scalability in mind. The user/client will interact with a web application or the frontend of a software or phone application, we can design the UI/UX through software such as Figma meant for application prototyping and implemented using JavaScript's React for a dynamic and responsive user interface; responsiveness is crucial when pushing real-time updates to users. 
The user's interaction with the application will result in a request sent to the app server, the backend services must first verify the user's credentials to ensure they should have access to the request they're making. We can use Python or Node.JS to build the app server and an autherization protocol such as OAuth2 can be used to build the authentication system. 
Once the user's credentials have been authenticated, an API call is sent out to the Game Data Management Service requesting some data that the user would like access to. Python or Node.JS can be used to build the GDMS, leveraging Flask or Express.js to handle HTTP requests. Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy could be used for data manipulation and statistical analysis as required. 
The GDMS will first try to query the Data Cache since it carries more frequently accessed data, then the Data Source otherwise. The GDMS can decide whether to update the Data Cache with the information based on the frequency of access. The Data Cache and Source can be built using database systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL or NoSQL. 
Once the GDMS has retrieved the appropriate data, it is processed as needed before being sent to the Real-Time Service to handle the real time data updates. The RTS in this application will leverage websockets to allow bidirectional access to data without the need for requests. Socket.io, WebSocket API, Node.JS' "ws" or Python's "websockets" can be leveraged.
The frontend of the application will listen to websocket connections in order to trigger a UI update when new data becomes available.
The Batch Data Processor serves to retrieve data from the Data Source based on an event trigger or a time interval trigger to update the Data Cache with newer and more relevant data to the users.

Some issues the current structure might face under the stress of 10,000 users accessing the application simultaneously are: Server overloads where the App Server and RTS become overloaded and bottleneck response times, limitations on server resources with 10,000 websocket connections, and database scalability. 
For server overloads, an appropriate solution would be to implement load balancers for the App Server and RTS to distribute traffic and avoid an overload and/or rate limiters to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage among users. For server resource limitation, multiplexing websocket connections can be used to manage the large number of connections in a more resource efficient manner. In terms of database scalability, there are many techniques to help mitigate those issues such as database sharding, different caching strategies (LRU, LFU..etc.), and horizontal scaling of resources.
